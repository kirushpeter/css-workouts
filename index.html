    <p>Spread over 2 hectares of tropical gardens, Tropicana Resort Phu Quoc features an outdoor pool and a private beach. Free Wi-Fi is provided at all public areas. On-site parking is free.

        Enjoying views of the gardens or sea, all the air-conditioned bungalows include a private terrace and seating area. Rattan furnishings and thatched roofs feature in some bungalows. En suite bathrooms are equipped with hot-water showers.
        
        Tropicana Resort Phu Quoc is a 15-minute walk from Duong Dong Market. It is 4 km from Phu Quoc Airport. The beautiful and famous white-sand Sao Beach and Dai Beach are a 50-minute drive away. It is accessible from Phu Quoc Airport, which is a 50-minute domestic flight from Ho Chi Minh City and a 2 hour, 10-minute domestic flight from Hanoi. Airport shuttle service is available at the property.
        
        Directly on the beach, the resort's restaurant serves Western and Asian dishes. Alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks are available at the bar.
        
        Guests can arrange day trips at the tour desk, or request for a massage. The resort also provides a business centre, laundry services and a 24-hour front desk.
